# Strait Diplomacy  
  
An alternate version of the classic game **Diplomacy**, set in the tumultuous Taiwan Strait where major powers vie for control.  

1. **Objective**:
   - The game's goal remains the same: **conquer 18 supply centers** to secure dominance.
   - However, the stakes are higher. Players represent nations with vested interests in the Taiwan Strait, including **China**, **Taiwan**, **the United States**, and other regional players.

2. **Game Board**:
   - The board depicts the Taiwan Strait, divided into coastal land spaces, sea spaces, and contested islands.
   - Key locations include **Taipei**, **Kaohsiung**, **Xiamen**, and the **Spratly Islands**.

3. **Units**:
   - Players control armies and fleets.
   - **Armies** represent ground forces, stationed on islands and coastal regions.
   - **Fleets** symbolize naval power, patrolling the waters.
   - **US Carrier Groups(航空母舰战斗群)** Represented by markers or tokens. These mobile powerhouses influence naval control and deterrence.
   - **Missile Silos (导弹发射井)** Depicted as threatening icons. missile capabilities directly impact Taiwan’s security.

4. **Orders and Diplomacy**:
   - Players submit orders secretly, but the game emphasizes **diplomatic negotiations**.
   - **Hold**: Units remain in place.
   - **Attack/Move**: Units advance to adjacent spaces.
   - **Support**: Units assist allies in defense or offense.
   - **Convoy**: Fleets transport armies across sea spaces.

5. **Special Rules**:
   - **Taiwan's Defense Drills**: Before each turn, Taiwan (controlled by a neutral player) conducts defense drills. Players must navigate around these exercises.
   - **US Intervention**: The US (also controlled by a neutral player) can deploy additional units to support Taiwan or deter aggression.
   - **Escalation Markers**: As tensions rise, players accumulate escalation markers. These allow for more aggressive actions but risk international backlash.

6. **Alliances and Betrayals**:
   - Players negotiate alliances, sharing intelligence and coordinating moves.
   - **China-Taiwan Alliance**: Unlikely but powerful if maintained.
   - **US Support**: Players can seek US backing or undermine it.

7. **Winning Conditions**:
   - **China**: Control Taiwan and key islands.
   - **Taiwan**: Survive and maintain sovereignty.
   - **US**: Prevent full-scale conflict.
   - **Other Powers**: Secure influence without direct confrontation.

8. **Events**:
   - **Speaker Pelosi's Visit**: When the US Speaker of the House visits Taiwan, tensions escalate. Players must adapt.
   - **Military Exercises**: China conducts large-scale drills, affecting movement and supply centers.
   - **Media Influence**: Players can sway global opinion through media campaigns.

Remember, in **Strait Diplomacy**, alliances are fragile, and betrayal is common. Trust no one—especially when aircraft carriers loom on the horizon and drones buzz overhead. 🌊🚢🗺️
