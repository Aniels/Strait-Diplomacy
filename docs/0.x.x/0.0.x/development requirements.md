# Development Requirements
A comprehensive guide for the development team to align on project goals, focusing on the functional and non-functional requirements.  
  
## Functional Requirements  
  
1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:  
   - Ability for users to register, log in, and manage their accounts.  
   - Implement role-based access control for different user roles (players, moderators) with specific permissions.  
  
2. **Game Management**:  
   - **Create Game Room**:  
     - Enable players to create new game rooms with customizable game parameters (map variant, turn duration).  
   - **Join Game Room**:  
     - Provide functionality for players to join existing game rooms.  
   - **Game State Transitions**:  
     - Seamlessly handle different phases such as negotiation and resolution.  
     - Update the game state dynamically based on player actions.  
  
3. **Player Actions**:  
   - **Submit Orders**:  
     - Establish API endpoints for order submissions.  
     - Ensure order validation and conformity with game rules.  
   - **Negotiation**:  
     - Facilitate in-game communication during negotiation phases.  
  
4. **Game State and Persistence**:  
   - Maintain persistent game state (unit positions, territory ownership) using a robust database.  
   - Develop data models for various game entities like countries, units, and players.  
   - Incorporate functionality for saving and loading game states.  
  
5. **Adjudication and Resolution**:  
   - Process and adjudicate submitted orders to reflect changes in the game state.  
   - Implement logic to detect game outcomes such as stalemates, wins, and draws.  
   - Handle conflict resolution mechanisms (support, convoy).  
  
6. **Notifications and Real-Time Updates**:  
   - Implement a system to alert players about important game events (e.g., turn changes, messages).  
   - Use WebSockets for real-time game state updates.  
  
## Non-Functional Requirements  
  
1. **Performance**:  
   - Aim for optimal API response times.  
   - Ensure system stability under concurrent game sessions.  
  
2. **Scalability**:  
   - Architect the backend for easy horizontal scaling.  
   - Accommodate an increasing number of users and game rooms.  
  
3. **Security**:  
   - Implement robust user authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT).  
   - Safeguard sensitive data, including passwords and game states.  
  
4. **Reliability**:  
   - Strive for high availability with minimal system downtime.  
   - Incorporate thorough error handling and logging mechanisms.  
  
5. **Documentation**:  
   - Provide comprehensive API documentation detailing endpoints and data exchange formats.  
  
6. **Testing and Validation**:  
   - Conduct unit testing for all API endpoints.  
   - Ensure rigorous validation of game rules and scenarios.  
  
7. **Deployment**:  
   - Deploy the backend on a stable and reliable cloud server platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
